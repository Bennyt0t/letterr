                I want to start by saying how thankful I am that you've accepted me for who I am. I know I'm not perfect, 
                but I'm doing my best to be the best person that you will love.
                I really love you, more than words can express. Thereâ€™s something about you that I can't quite explain, but I know I love you deeply. 
                You're truly unique, and no one can compare to you. You're one of a kind.
                This message is special because I love you, and that's something only you can truly understand.
